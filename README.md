# LSystems
LSystems are a simple grammar and set of rules which, when repeatedly applied, create new patterns recursively. One may assign basic "turtle" drawing commands to the symbols of the grammar and get interesting fractal images. My Python script is set up to generate several of these fractals using very simple rules.
